//Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10,
// and then asks the user to try to guess it.
// When the user enters a guess, compare it with
// the random generated number, and then tell the user
// if the guess was correct, or not.
//Since we want a number between 1 and 10 (instead of 0 to 9), we add 1 to shift the range.
//
//This transforms the range from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} â†’ to {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.
